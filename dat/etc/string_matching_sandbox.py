pdf_desc = "Arcol LG-650 polyether polyol is a 260-molecular-weight polypropylene oxide-based triol. The terminal end-groups are predominantly secondary hydroxyls and have a relatively low reactivity. It is compatible with some polyether polyols and can be blended with other diols or triols to achieve desirable modifications of product properties. Arcol LG-650 polyol is typically used in a broad range of urethane foam and other applications, including structural coatings, hard coatings, potting compounds, and thermal break. As with any product, the use of Arcol LG-650 polyol in a given application must be tested (including but not limited to field testing) in advance by the user to determine suitability"
